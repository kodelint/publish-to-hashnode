## Repository Structure

### Tags

```yaml
# ‚úÖ Good tags
tags: ["javascript", "web-development", "tutorial", "beginners"]

# ‚ùå Avoid these
tags: ["JavaScript", "Web Development", "Tutorial!!!", "js/ts"]
```

- Use lowercase
- Use hyphens instead of spaces
- Keep to 3-5 tags per post
- Be specific and relevant

### Custom Slugs

```yaml
# ‚úÖ Good slugs
slug: "advanced-react-patterns"
slug: "docker-compose-tutorial-2024"

# ‚ùå Avoid these
slug: "Advanced React Patterns!!!"
slug: "docker_compose tutorial"
```

- Use only letters, numbers, and hyphens
- Keep under 100 characters
- Make them descriptive and SEO-friendly

### Publication Dates

```yaml
# ‚úÖ Recommended formats
publishedAt: "2024-08-20T10:00:00.000Z"    # Full ISO format
publishedAt: "2024-08-20"                   # Simple date
publishedAt: "2024-08-20T14:30:00-05:00"   # With timezone

# ‚ùå Avoid these
publishedAt: "August 20th, 2024"           # Ambiguous format
publishedAt: "2024/08/20"                  # Wrong separator
```

### Cover Images

- Use high-quality images (1600x840px recommended)
- Ensure images are publicly accessible
- Consider using Hashnode's CDN for better performance
- Include alt text in your post content

### SEO Optimization

```yaml
title: "Complete Guide to Docker for Developers" # Clear, descriptive
metaDescription: "Learn Docker from basics to production deployment with practical examples and best practices." # Under 160 chars
slug: "complete-docker-guide-developers" # SEO-friendly URL
```

Here's how you might organize your blog repository:

```
your-blog-repo/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .github/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ workflows/
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ publish-to-hashnode.yml

```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Missing or invalid metadata"**

- Ensure `title` and `tags` are present in frontmatter
- Tags must be an array: `tags: ["tag1", "tag2"]`
- Check YAML syntax with a validator

**"Invalid date format"**

- Use ISO 8601 format: `"2024-08-20T10:00:00.000Z"`
- Or simple date: `"2024-08-20"`
- Always use quotes around dates

**"Could not extract post ID from URL"**

- The `publishedUrl` in frontmatter may be malformed
- Action will create a new post instead of updating
- Remove `publishedUrl` to force new post creation

**"API request failed: 401"**

- Check your Hashnode Personal Access Token
- Ensure token has publishing permissions
- Verify token is stored correctly in GitHub Secrets

**"Publication not found"**

- Verify your `publication_id` is correct
- Check you have publishing rights to the publication

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the action logs in your GitHub Actions tab
2. Verify your Hashnode PAT has the correct permissions
3. Ensure your publication ID is correct
4. [Open an issue](https://github.com/kodelint/publish-to-hashnode/issues) with details

## Advanced Features

### Working with Series

To add posts to a series, you need the series ID from Hashnode:

1. Go to your Hashnode dashboard
2. Navigate to your series
3. Copy the series ID from the URL or settings
4. Add it to your post frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "Part 3: Advanced Docker Networking"
seriesId: "docker-mastery-series-id"
tags: ["docker", "networking", "containers"]
---
```

### Co-Authoring Posts

For collaborative posts, add co-author usernames:

```yaml
---
title: "Building Microservices: A Team Perspective"
coAuthors: ["backend-expert", "frontend-guru"]
tags: ["microservices", "architecture", "collaboration"]
---
```

### SEO Optimization

Maximize your post's discoverability:

```yaml
---
title: "Complete Kubernetes Tutorial for Beginners"
metaDescription: "Learn Kubernetes from scratch with hands-on examples, deployments, and production best practices."
slug: "kubernetes-tutorial-beginners-2024"
tags: ["kubernetes", "devops", "tutorial", "beginners"]
enableTableOfContents: true
---
```

### Content Migration

When migrating from other platforms, preserve SEO value:

```yaml
---
title: "My Journey from Medium to Hashnode"
canonicalUrl: "https://medium.com/@username/migration-story"
isRepublished:
  originalArticleURL: "https://medium.com/@username/migration-story"
tags: ["blogging", "migration", "writing"]
---
```

### Scheduled Publishing

While the action doesn't directly support scheduling, you can:

1. Set future dates in `publishedAt`
2. Use GitHub's scheduled workflows
3. Store posts as drafts until ready

```yaml
# In your workflow
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 9 * * 1" # Every Monday at 9 AM

# In your post
---
title: "Weekly Update: What's New in Tech"
publishedAt: "2024-08-26T09:00:00.000Z" # Next Monday
isDraft: false
---
```

## Advanced Usage Patterns

### Multiple Publications

You can publish to different publications based on conditions:

```yaml
- name: Publish to Tech Blog
  if: contains(github.event.head_commit.message, '[tech]')
  uses: kodelint/publish-to-hashnode@v1
  with:
    src: "./posts"
    hashnode_pat: ${{ secrets.HASHNODE_PAT }}
    publication_id: ${{ secrets.TECH_PUBLICATION_ID }}

- name: Publish to Personal Blog
  if: contains(github.event.head_commit.message, '[personal]')
  uses: kodelint/publish-to-hashnode@v1
  with:
    src: "./posts"
    hashnode_pat: ${{ secrets.HASHNODE_PAT }}
    publication_id: ${{ secrets.PERSONAL_PUBLICATION_ID }}
```

### Scheduled Publishing

Publish posts on a schedule:

```yaml
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 9 * * 1" # Every Monday at 9 AM UTC

jobs:
  scheduled-publish:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: kodelint/publish-to-hashnode@v1
        with:
          src: "./scheduled-posts"
          hashnode_pat: ${{ secrets.HASHNODE_PAT }}
          publication_id: ${{ secrets.HASHNODE_PUBLICATION_ID }}
```
